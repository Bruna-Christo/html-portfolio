<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a digital product professional with extensive experience in the banking sector and B2B products. I've worked on diverse
   projects, from enhancing user experiences to developing payment solutions. I have hands-on experience with waterfall,
    Scrum Agile, and SAFe methodologies. Additionally, collaborating with colleagues from various nationalities has been
     incredibly beneficial, providing me with valuable insights into different perspectives and viewpoints.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy running, playing futsal, and diving into history and self-empowerment books.
I strongly believe that nothing is impossible. However, it's crucial to understand the situation and learn to navigate it.
<br>Life has been an incredible learning journey for me, and it continues to be. Every challenge has either been a lesson that shaped
 who I am today or an opportunity to mentor others to the best of my abilities.
